Introduction to Machine Learning: A comprehensive repository to getting started with the basics of Machine Learning inparticular machine learning. This repository firstly contains building a neural network and covering the fundamental concepts and techniques used in machine learning.Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer looking to brush up your skills, this repository has something for everyone. I will be writing most of this code from to help with understanding. Get started today and dive into the exciting world of machine learning!
## Basic Introduction
Machine Learning can seem a bit difficult and that is because it is. I actually making this repository so that I can understand it a little bit better. Firstly, I will put some prereqs that are needed to help you understand machine learning. These prerequiestes are not needed but will be very helpful in understanding concepts.
### Prerequisites 
- Linear Algebra - is almost essencial to have a greater understanding of neural network because they are literally just a bunch of weights, inputs and bias which produce an output. You can understand machine learning without understanding that much linear algbra but it would be more difficult

- Calculus - is needed for back propagation and is the main "Learning Part" of machine learning. You do not need to understand this as much as it is extremely difficult to understand. I feel like it would be better to try and abstract away from back propagation. I think understanding the basic principles of differial calculus would be helpful and the chain rule. Understanding multivariable calculus is not necessary but is helpful

- Basic Programming - is needed if you would like to make your own in a different language such as Java or C++. Object oriented programming is very useful.

## Regression vs Classification in Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is where you have data that a computer can use to with, as you have an input and a correct output, this is different to unsupervised learning which does not have the correct output associated with the inputs
